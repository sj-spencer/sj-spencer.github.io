Abstract: Inflationary Stimulated Raman Scattering (iSRS) is a Laser-Plasma Interaction which arises in the kinetic regime of direct-drive ICF plasmas; it acts to reflect laser light away from the target and produces hot electrons which pre-heat the target making it harder to compress. For this reason, we would like to understand where/when/why iSRS occurs, so that we can act to mitigate it. In this talk, we will present results of the first simulations of iSRS in inhomogeneous plasmas with NIF-relevant parameters and scale-lengths. An increased understanding of the link between coronal density scale-lengths and reflectivity due to SRS and iSRS is of significant interest to the development of shock-ignition ICF schemes.
