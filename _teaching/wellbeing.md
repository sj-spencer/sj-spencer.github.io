Wellbeing officer
==========================
I identified the need for a post-graduate wellbeing programme in the Physics department. I conducted a consulation with post-graduate students in the department and have since put in place:
* A weekly “wellbeing coffee” event which encourages discussion of self-care and community-care.
* A wellbeing Discord server for students to share advice and ask for help.
* A revamp of the wellbeing resources provided to students joining the department.

If you would like to talk about setting up your own student wellbeing group, please get in touch!
