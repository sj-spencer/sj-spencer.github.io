I identified the need for a post-graduate wellbeing programme in the Physics department. I conducted a consulation with post-graduate students in the department and have since put in place: a weekly “wellbeing coffee” event which encourages discussion of self-care and community-care; a wellbeing Discord server for students to share advice and ask for help. I also worked with the department to revamp the wellbeing resources provided to students joining the department.

If you would like to talk about setting up your own student wellbeing group, please get in touch!
