Mathematics for Physicists
==========================
I am a class teacher for the first-year undergraduate module [PX149 Mathematics for Physicists](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/aro/dar/quality/modules/undergraduate/px/px149/). I plan and deliver two maths classes a week, as well as grading student’s assignments. I use the expertise developed in my mathematics degree to build on the material covered in lectures,
to help my students construct their own coherent mathematical toolkit.

Testimonials from students
==========================
Each term I give my students the opportunity to give anonymous feedback on my teaching and their experience of our classes. I have designed a google form for this feedback, which I can send to other graduate student teachers upon request. Here is some of the feedback I have got from my students:

<blockquote>
    <p>At the start of the year the class was daunting as I wasn’t confident in my own abilities. However as the year proceeded I was able to feel confident in my abilities and on par with classmates</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Genuinely one of my favourite parts of the week. Always looked forward to them because they helped me a lot!</p>
