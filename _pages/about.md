I am currently a PhD student at the University of Warwick working on Laser-Plasma Interactions relevant to Shock Ignition, where I am supervised by Professor Tony Arber, and Dr Keith Bennett.

My primary research interests involve the use of PIC codes to probe the fundamental physics of plasma instabilities. I am currently working as part of a team to understand laser-plasma interactions (LPI) in the shock-ignition model of inertial confinement fusion. I am responsible for simulating LPI phenomena (specifically Stimulated Raman Scattering (SRS) and inflationary SRS) which we expect to play a role in our collaborationâ€™s experiments on the Omega laser system.

I am interested in how the first-principles PIC method can fail to reproduce instabilities observed in experiments; for example, how SBS reflectivity is greatly over-estimated in simulations compared to experiments. I will eventually be working on simulating realistic laser speckles and studying their impact on LPI evolution. 

I am also working on PIC simulations of the electron-positron jets produced by micro-quasar systems, studying the filamentation instability in the protons of the interstellar medium in order to explain observations of well-collimated jets with speeds up to 0.9c.
