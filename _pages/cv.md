Education
======
* PhD in Physics, University of Warwick, 2021 (expected)
* BSc (Hons) Mathematics, University of Warwick, 2017

Work experience
======
* Winter Quarter 2020: Junior Specialist
  * University of California, San Diego
  * Ran particle-in-cell simulations of magnetised plasmas in support of an experiment performed on the
